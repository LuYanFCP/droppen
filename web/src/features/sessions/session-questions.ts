/**
 * The questions an agent stops to ask (`AskUserQuestion`), as the transcript's
 * question card and the composer see them.
 *
 * A resident claude runs with `--permission-prompt-tool stdio`, so when the
 * model calls `AskUserQuestion` the CLI blocks the turn *mid-flight* and the
 * server holds the question open until somebody answers it through the API.
 * The session's state carries every recent question with what became of it
 * (`SessionQuestion`), and the card a question draws in the transcript is
 * joined to its record by the `tool_use` id both of them name.
 *
 * The card used to pre-fill the composer and send an ordinary message, which
 * was the only thing a client could do while the CLI simply refused the tool.
 * Now the answer goes *into the turn that asked*, so the agent carries on from
 * the question with the answer in hand — and the decision about what a set of
 * ticks and typed words amounts to as an answer lives here, where it can be
 * tested without a DOM.
 *
 * Pure, and free of React.
