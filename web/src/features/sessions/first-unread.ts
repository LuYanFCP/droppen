/**
 * The way back to where a visit's unread messages begin: the decisions.
 *
 * Arriving at a session at its newest message marks it read straight away
 * (`useReportSeen`), which is right for the badge and leaves the reader who
 * came back to twelve answers looking at the last of them. So the report an
 * arrival sends brings back the mark it replaced — when the reader had last
 * looked — and the server is asked where the first message after that is
 * (`GET /api/sessions/{source}/{id}/first-unread?after=`). Nothing the client
 * holds is trusted for that mark: a feed row can be stale (a socket that
 * dropped while the phone slept keeps its old rows) or missing (a page opened
 * straight from a notification), and the report is what moves it anyway.
 *
 * Arrivals are the session opened, the tab or window come back to, its pane
 * given the focus, and a notification about it tapped while it is on screen.
 * The jump is the in-session search's own (`useSessionSearch().jumpToItem`),
 * which already knows how to page history in to an item that is not loaded
 * yet and flash it; the button stays up while it does, with a way to stop it,
 * and says so if it could not get there.
 *
 * Pure, so every rule is a test away; `first-unread-view.tsx` is the half
 * that touches the DOM and the network.
